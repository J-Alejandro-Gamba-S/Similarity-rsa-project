# Similarity Judgments & RSA Analysis Project

This repository contains all analysis scripts, data, and resources for a project investigating similarity judgments across multiple similarity properties and using representational similarity analysis (RSA) on behavioral, neural and CNN data to evaluate which properties correlate with different cortical brain regions and which conditions are required for CNNs and algorithmic structures to correlate with the other 2 modalities. It also assess the relationships and correlations across different correlation metrics and correlation methods. Besides, it explores the methodological constraints on noise ceilings and propose a different alternative to visualize and assess them in the context of multi-modal RSA, particularly for fMRI.

## ðŸ™Œ Acknowledgments ##

* This project builds upon and adapts several open-source tools and models. We are grateful to the developers and communities maintaining these resources:

- The folder `Python/image-similarity/` is adapted from the open-source repository [ryanfwy/image-similarity](https://github.com/ryanfwy/image-similarity), originally based on MobileNet (Howard et al., 2017). We modified it for local image processing and offline cosine similarity estimation.

- For pretrained deep learning models, we used `MobileNet`, `ResNet-50`, and the Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED) network. These models were accessed via `torchvision` and custom implementations, and were either used as-is or fine-tuned for category, animacy, and shape-based classification tasks.

- The Canny edge detector (Canny, 1986) and structural similarity index (SSIM) were employed to estimate shape-based similarity using classical computer vision techniques.

- Color-based dissimilarity was computed using histogram distributions and clustering-based color extraction, relying on `OpenCV` and `scikit-learn`.

- The ResNet-50 architecture was also fine-tuned for category and animacy classification. These models were trained using PyTorch, leveraging stratified splits, augmentation pipelines, and feature embedding extraction to generate similarity matrices.
